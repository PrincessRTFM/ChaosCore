# ChaosCore

## What is ChaosCore?
ChaosCore is my general Java utility library. It's a collection of miscellaneous functions and classes for a variety of purposes.

## Can I use ChaosCore?
Sure! Anyone can use ChaosCore, provided you follow the license. I'd also appreciate it if you could credit me if you use my code.

## What's the license say?
According to [GitHub's choose-a-license site](http://choosealicense.com/):

> The GPL (V2 or V3) is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms. V3 is similar to V2, but further restricts use in hardware that forbids software alterations.

ChaosCore is under the GPL V3 license, so the basic summary is this: if you use my code (or a derivative thereof), you need to release your code under the same license.

## Why the name ChaosCore?
Have you seen my code? It's all chaos.
